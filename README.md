# Python-Bioinformatics
Porting the code in my Bioinformatics Specialization repository to Python

I am aware that I will be re-writing some of this code, since I took the introductory class in Python. However, this time I will not be simply copying from the class. I am doing this in the hopes of re-creating what happened when I did all the classes in Java. That is,

* Practicing proper code documentation
* Learning about Python data structures from extended use
* Practicing algorithm designing (I'll try to improve the algorithms)

And something that I didn't do during the Java coding - frequent commits! I'll try, that's all I'll say.
Update later: the commits may not look "frequent" - I just went 17 days in-between! However, I commit whenever I'm working on this. So I went 17 days without coding fun stuff at all - hence the lact of commits.
